Each week we will provide you with a few questions (_multiple choice_ or _open ended_) to help you prepare for the final exam. We strongly encourage you to review these questions and discuss them with your instructors after the lecture. The solutions to all of these problems will be provided at the very end of the course, but before the final exam.
