# Week 2: Experimental Research

1.  Read the following hypotheses and identify the independent and dependent variables in each hypothesis.
    1.  _There is no difference in users’ reading speed and retention rate when they view the news on a smart phone or on their laptop._
    2.  _There is no difference in target selection speed and error rate between joystick, touch screen and gesture recognition._
    3.  _There is no difference in the analytical reasoning skills of the children who used Khan Academy videos to learn as compared to the ones who used a book._
2.  Imagine you have been tasked to evaluate a brand new **smart walking stick for visually impaired users**. As a result, you design an experiment and recruit 35 visually impaired users within the city of Rotterdam. Each participant will have to use the *new smart stick* and the *conventional walking stick*. 
    1.  _Describe what kind of experiment is this (true, quasi, or non-experiment), and what can you say about the design of the study (between-group, within-group or split-plot)?_
    2.  _Describe how you can prevent or mitigate sources of random and systematic errors in your study design?_
3.  Read the following situations that may happen during an experiment and comment if they are sources or random errors, systematic errors, or both.
    1.  _You only recruit males to participate in your experiment._
    2.  _The sensors that you are using to measure participants’ stress levels are not accurate._
    3.  _Your participants are often disturbed by loud voices from outside the room._
4.  Design a **quasi-experiment** to validate/invalidate the following Null Hypothesis. Please choose the most appropriate design (*between-, within-group or split-plot; factorial vs. non-factorial design*) for your study and explain the rationale behind your choices.
    *   _“There is no difference in reading speed and retention rate when users read a news on smart phones, laptops, and newspapers.”_
