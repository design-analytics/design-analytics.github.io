# Week 3: Research Methods

1.  Please indicate which of the following is true about surveys as a design study.
    1.  _Surveys belong to the category of **True Experiments**._
    2.  _Surveys belong to the category of **Quasi Experiments**._
    3.  _Surveys belong to the category of **Non-Experiments**._
    4.  _All of the above are true._ <!--- Correct. --->
2.  You have been tasked by TU Delft to administer a survey to first year MSc students on the perceived study-life balance. This survey is intended for the first year MSc students of all faculties within TU Delft. Describe how you will define the different strata within your target populations and what aspects will you consider while conducting stratified random sampling to ensure less bias and error in survey responses?
3.  Suppose you are planning to conduct a survey to capture the different usage patterns of ChatGPT among students at TU Delft. Therefore, you only recruit participants who have used ChatGPT in their studies. This kind of sampling approach is referred to as?
    1.  _Random Sampling._
    2.  _Snowball Sampling._
    3.  _Intercept Sampling._ <!--- Correct. --->
    4.  _Non-probabilistic Sampling._
4.  Imagine that you and your friend have been tasked with the analysis of interview data. The interview was conducted with high-school teachers about the perceived relevance of a NEW smart awareness tool that can inform them about the levels of attention and fatigue of students in classroom. In this way, the teachers can potentially better self-regulate their teaching pace. Since, this is an entirely new product which has not been tested or analyzed in any other context, and assuming that no theoretical frameworks exist to explain the phenomena, which coding approach would you use (Emergent or A Priori) and why? Also illustrate the different stages of the coding process that you will follow.
5.  Cohen's Kappa ($K$) is a standardised measure for calculating \textbf{inter-coder reliability} in Content Analysis. The formula for computing Cohen's Kappa is given below:
