_a. Dependent Variable: Time Spent on App_

Considering the above SPSS output of a multiple linear regression, answer the following three questions (4, 5 and 6).

4. Based on the SPSS output above for a multiple linear regression analysis with 'Time Spent on App' as the dependent variable, which of the following statements is correct?

   1. _The visual appeal of the app does not significantly affect the time users spend on the app, as indicated by the high significance level._
   2. _User engagement, as measured by time spent on the app, is most strongly influenced by the number of features used during a session._
   3. _Ease of navigation is negatively related to the time spent on the app, meaning as navigation becomes easier, users spend less time on the app._
   4. _The adjusted R Square value indicates that over 82% of the variance in the time users spend on the app can be explained by the number of features used, ease of navigation, and visual appeal combined._ <!--- Correct. --->

5. Given the hypothetical SPSS output for a multiple linear regression with 'Time Spent on App' as the dependent variable, what can be inferred about the importance of 'Ease of Navigation' as a predictor?

   1. _'Ease of Navigation' is an insignificant predictor since its coefficient is smaller than that of 'Visual Appeal'._
   2. _The t-value for 'Ease of Navigation' being the highest among predictors indicates it is the most statistically significant predictor of 'Time Spent on App'._ <!--- Correct. --->
   3. _'Ease of Navigation' has no predictive power as its confidence interval includes zero._
   4. _'Ease of Navigation' has a Beta value of .600, indicating it contributes to a 60% increase in 'Time Spent on App' for each unit increase in its score._

6. What does the significance value (Sig.) imply for the 'Number of Features Used' coefficient in relation to 'Time Spent on App'?

   1. _The Sig. value of .000 for 'Number of Features Used' suggests that it is statistically insignificant and should not be considered in the model._
   2. _Since the Sig. value is .000, it implies that the 'Number of Features Used' has no effect on 'Time Spent on App'._
   3. _The 'Number of Features Used' is highly significant in predicting 'Time Spent on App', as indicated by a Sig. value of .000._ <!--- Correct. --->
   4. _A Sig. value of .000 indicates that 'Number of Features Used' negatively impacts 'Time Spent on App'._

7. If the Pearson correlation coefficient between two variables is 0.8, what can we conclude?

   1. _There is a strong positive linear relationship between the variables._ <!--- Correct. --->
   2. _There is a strong negative linear relationship between the variables._
   3. _One variable can be perfectly predicted from the other variable._
   4. _The relationship between the variables is non-linear._

8. One of the key differences between correlation and regression is that:

   1. Correlation quantifies the strength of the relationship, while regression quantifies the direction. <!--- Correct. --->
   2. Correlation assumes the independent variable is fixed, while regression treats both variables as random.
   3. Correlation is a single statistic, while regression produces an equation.
   4. Correlation is symmetric, while regression is asymmetric with respect to the independent and dependent variables

9. You are examining the relationship between users' ratings for 'Ease of Use' and 'Overall Satisfaction' for a newly released mobile application. You calculate both Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients. The Pearson correlation coefficient is 0.65, while the Spearman correlation coefficient is 0.85. What can you infer from these results?

   1. _The relationship between 'Ease of Use' and 'Overall Satisfaction' is perfectly linear since both correlation coefficients are positive._
   2. _The higher Spearman correlation suggests that the relationship between the variables is monotonic but not necessarily linear._ <!--- Correct. --->
   3. _The discrepancy between the Pearson and Spearman coefficients indicates that there must be a calculation error._
   4. _A lower Pearson correlation suggests that 'Ease of Use' does not affect 'Overall Satisfaction' at all._
