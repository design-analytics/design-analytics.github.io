# Week 7: Analysis III

1.  Examine the following Quantile-Quantile (Q-Q) plot, and indicate which answer correctly describes the distribution of data.
![Q-Q Plot]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/Week-7-Prep-Q1.png)
    1.  _Q-Q plots are used to visually assess homogeneity of variance (homoscedasticity), and the data here is homoscedastic._
    2.  _Q-Q plots are used to visually assess homogeneity of variance (homoscedasticity), and the data here is heteroscedastic._
    3.  _Q-Q plots are used to visually assess normality, and the data is almost normally distributed._ <!--- Correct. --->
    4.  _Q-Q plots are used to visually assess normality, and the data is not at all normally distributed._

2.  Closely examine the following table obtained in SPSS after conducting Levene’s test, and choose the correct answer below.

   |              | Levene Statistic | df1 | df2 | Significance |
   | ------------ | ---------------- | --- | --- | ------------ |
   | Variable     | 8.1106           | 1    | 30  | 0.007871    |

   1.   _Levene’s test is used to assess the homogeneity of variance, and the results show that ‘Variable’ is homoscedastic._
   2.   _Levene’s test is used to assess the homogeneity of variance, and the results show that ‘Variable’ is heteroscedastic._ <!--- Correct. --->
   3.   _Levene’s test is used to assess the normality of distribution, and the results show that ‘Variable’ is normally distributed._
   4.   _Levene’s test is used to assess the normality of distribution, and the results show that ‘Variable’ is not normally distributed._

3.  You have collected data on vitamin D levels for groups of Finish, Dutch and Italians. Your data is non-normally distributed. Which non-parametric test are you going to use to find if there are any significant differences among these groups?
    1.  _Independent Samples t-test_
    2.  _Kruskal-Wallis test_ <!--- Correct. --->
    3.  _Friendman's test_
    4.  _Chi-square test_

4.  Regression analysis was used to examine the relationship between the amount of time students spent (x; in hours) studying and their exam scores (y) for high school students. The following regression equation was obtained:

    **y = 31.9 + 0.84 x**
    
    Based on the estimated regression equation above, if the amount of time were increased by 1 hour, which of the following choices would apply?
    1.  _Exam Score will increase by 0.84_ <!--- Correct. --->
    2.  _Exam Score will increase by 31.9_
    3.  _Exam Score will increase by 32.74_
    4.  _Exam Score will decrease by 0.84_
