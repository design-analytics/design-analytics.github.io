# Week 5: Analysis I

1.  Which of the following lists has the highest **standard deviation**?
    1.  _98, 99, 100, 101, 102_
    2.  _2, 5, 6, 8, 10_
    3.  _13, 13, 16, 19, 22_
    4.  _2, 11_
2.  In an experiment, 10 participants take the following amount of time (in minutes) to complete a task:
    *   _7, 19, 2, 10, 42, 32, 18, 19, 44, 5_
    
    What is the **mean**, **median**, and **mode** of this data?
    1.  _Mean = 20.5, Median = 19.5, Mode = 32_
    2.  _Mean = 19.8, Median = 18.5, Mode = 19_
    3.  _Mean = 20.5, Median = 20.5, Mode = 18.5_
    4.  _Mean = 19.8, Median = 18.5, Mode = 18.5_
3.  Samples of a pharmaceutical product are routinely tested for the presence of a dangerous toxin. The outcome of the test could be formulated as a **null** and **alternative** hypothesis in the following way:
    *   _**H0:** The sample does not contain the toxin._
    *   _**H1:** The sample contains the toxin._
    
    What is the consequence of making a **Type I** error in the context of this test?
    1.  _The sample is discarded when it actually contains the toxin._
    2.  _The sample is discarded when it actually doesn’t contain the toxin._
    3.  _The sample is kept when it actually contains the toxin._
    4.  _The sample is kept when it actually doesn’t contain the toxin._
4.  Which of these conditions would result in the highest statistical power for a significance test?
    1.  _A significance level of ⍺ = 0.10 and a sample size of n = 150._
    2.  _A significance level of ⍺ = 0.10 and a sample size of n = 300._
    3.  _A significance level of ⍺ = 0.01 and a sample size of n = 150._
    4.  _A significance level of ⍺ = 0.01 and a sample size of n = 300._
5.  The table shown below illustrates the result obtained from a One-Way ANOVA test. Please fill in the following detail based on the information available in the table:

    1.  _What is the Mean Square value for Between-group setting? Also, briefly elaborate how you computed this value._
    2.  _What is the Mean Square value for Within-group setting? Also, briefly elaborate how you computed this value._
    3.  _What is the value of the F-statistic? Briefly elaborate how you computed this value._

6.  The table shown above illustrates the result obtained from a **One-Way ANOVA** test. Given that the **F<sub>Critical</sub>** value for the aforementioned values of degrees of freedom, i.e., **2** and **21**, is **3.47**. Please describe whether the two conditions are significantly different from one another or not? Also, describe how did you reach the conclusion about the statistical significance (or its lack)?
