    2.  A theory is a broad explanation that integrates many hypotheses and observations, while a law is a precise statement that describes a fundamental principle of nature.
    3.  A theory is a provisional explanation that may change as new evidence is discovered, while a law is a definitive statement that remains constant regardless of new findings.
    4.  A theory is a hypothesis that has been extensively tested and verified, while a law is a principle that is still under investigation and subject to change.
