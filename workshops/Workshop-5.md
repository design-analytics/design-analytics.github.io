# Workshop 5: Introduction to SPSS

This workshop introduces SPSS, a software for data analysis. We will cover the basics of using SPSS like the interface, variable types, importing data, calculating descriptives, and creating basic plots.

This workshop uses a dataset collected during the previous session. You will get hands-on practice with SPSS by working with this real-world dataset. Learning SPSS now will prepare you to analyze data for your own projects later in the course.
