# Workshop 3: Extraneous Variables and How to Control Them

This workshop session is twofold, where you will first examine the extraneous and conntecting variables before focusing on the practical aspects of setting up experiments. The learning goals for this week are designed to enhance your ability to critically assess and implement research steps for technological prototype evaluation. Here are the learning objectives:

**Identify and Define Extraneous and Connecting Variables:** Gain an understanding of extraneous variables that could affect the outcome of an experiment and learn strategies to control these variables. This knowledge is critical for ensuring the validity of your research findings by minimizing potential confounding factors.

**Designing Experiments with Clear Objectives:** Learn how to design experiments that clearly define participant roles, tasks, and the overall setup. This includes formulating clear objectives, selecting appropriate tasks for participants, and establishing a controlled environment for the experiment.
