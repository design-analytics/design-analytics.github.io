# Workshop 7: Data Visualization in SPSS

In this workshop, we will focus on visualizing our research data using SPSS. Data visualization helps us communicate our findings clearly and see patterns or relationships within the data.

We will start by exploring a variety of visualization techniques available in SPSS, including box plots, scatter plots, bar graphs, and charts. You will learn how to create these visualizations and customize them to best suit your data and research questions. For example, you will discover how to create box plots to examine the distribution and identify potential outliers in your data, and how to use scatter plots to explore the relationships between different variables. We will also discuss the importance of choosing the right visualization method based on the type of data and the insights you aim to convey.

By the end of this workshop, you will be equipped with the skills to effectively communicate your research findings through informative data visualizations to draw meaningful conclusions.
