# Workshop 6: Analysis with SPSS I

In this workshop, we will continue with statistical analysis using SPSS. We will cover a range of inferential statistical techniques, including ANOVA (Analysis of Variance), t-tests, and their nonparametric equivalents.

First, we will learn how to conduct t-Tests and ANOVA to compare the means of groups. You will learn how to perform both independent-samples and paired-samples t-tests, one-way ANOVA and repeated measures ANOVA and when to use each type. This will allow us to understand if there are significant differences between the groups based on our collected data. We will also explore the assumptions underlying these tests and discuss how to check for them. If the assumptions are not met, we will learn about nonparametric alternatives, such as the Kruskal-Wallis or Mann-Whitney U, and how to apply them in SPSS.

By the end of this workshop, you will be equipped with the knowledge and skills to conduct a wide range of inferential statistical analyses using SPSS. This will enable you to draw meaningful conclusions from your research data and make informed decisions based on your findings.
